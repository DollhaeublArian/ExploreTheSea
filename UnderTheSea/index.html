    <h1>Epipelagic Zone (0-200 Meters):</h1>

    <div class="block">
        The uppermost layer of the ocean is known as the epipelagic zone, extending from the sea surface to a depth of about 200 meters. This zone is characterized by ample sunlight that can penetrate to great depths, allowing for photosynthesis and promoting the growth of algae and phytoplankton. The epipelagic zone is rich in nutrients and hosts a variety of marine life, including fish, marine mammals, and birds.

    <h1>Mesopelagic Zone (200-1000 Meters):</h1>
    <img src="Picture/squid.png" alt="Squid">
    <div class="block">
        Below the epipelagic zone lies the mesopelagic zone, spanning depths between 200 and 1000 meters. In this zone, sunlight rapidly diminishes, and it becomes increasingly darker. Pressure rises, and temperatures become colder. Most fish in the mesopelagic zone are adapted to darkness and possess bioluminescent organs for orientation and communication.

<section class="container" id="bathypelagic">
    <h1>Bathypelagic Zone (1000-4000 Meters):</h1>
    <img src="Picture/jellyfish.png" alt="Jellyfish">
    <div class="block">
        The bathypelagic zone extends from 1000 to 4000 meters depth and is a region of extreme conditions. At this depth, it is nearly dark, temperatures are near freezing, and pressure reaches immense values. Nevertheless, there are amazing life forms adapted to these extreme conditions, including jellyfish, deep-sea anglerfish, and other bizarre creatures.

    <h1>Abyssopelagic Zone (4000-6000 Meters):</h1>
    <img src="Picture/anglerfish.png" alt="Anglerfish">
    <div class="block">
        Deeper still is the abyssopelagic zone, ranging from 4000 meters to the seafloor. Here, we encounter some of the unexplored deep-sea areas where pressure and darkness are extreme. Life forms in this zone have developed incredible adaptations to survive in this inhospitable environment. Here, we encounter deep-sea giants like giant squids and peculiar species relying on food sources from volcanism and hydrothermal vents.

    <h1>Hadopelagic Zone (Below 6000 Meters):</h1>
    <img src="Picture/microorganism.png" alt="Microorganism">
    <div class="block">
        The deepest marine zone is the hadopelagic zone, encompassing depths of over 6000 meters. These extreme depths are challenging to access and represent one of the last great unexplored regions on Earth. Conditions in this zone are extreme, with extremely high pressure, extremely low temperatures, and minimal light. Only a few organisms have adapted to these extreme conditions, including some bacteria and single-celled organisms.
